    <h1>The Whisper of the Stars</h1>
    <p>
        Beneath the vast and endless sky,<br>
        Where whispers of the stars drift by,<br>
        Their twinkle tells a secret tale,<br>
        Of cosmic dreams and midnight sail.<br><br>

        A melody of light and hue,<br>
        In shadows deep, in skies so blue,<br>
        They hum a tune, serene, divine,<br>
        A lullaby for hearts that pine.<br><br>

        So gaze above, let wonders start,<br>
        Let starlight soothe your weary heart,<br>
        For in their glow, a truth abides,<br>
        The universe within us hides.
